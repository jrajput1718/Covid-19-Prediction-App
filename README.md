#  COVID-19 Prediction Using Machine Learning

A **Flask-based Machine Learning Web Application** that predicts the likelihood of COVID-19 infection based on user symptoms.  
This project uses three machine learning models — **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** — to classify patient data and provide a probability of infection.  
It also includes a **Matplotlib-based model comparison graph** showing model accuracies.

##  Aim
To develop an **intelligent COVID-19 prediction system** that takes patient symptoms as input and classifies whether the person is **COVID-positive or negative** using supervised machine learning algorithms.

---

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can assist in early health diagnostics and decision-making.  
The system uses a dataset of patient symptoms and health conditions, trains multiple models, compares their accuracies, and deploys the best-performing model through a **Flask web app**.

##  Installation & Setup

###  Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/covid-ml-app.git
cd covid-ml-app/backend
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Train the Model
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
✅ This will:

Load and preprocess dataset

Train 3 models (RandomForest, LogisticRegression, SVM)

Compare their accuracies using Matplotlib

Save the best-performing model as model.pkl

5️⃣ Run the Flask App
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Then open your browser and go to:

cpp

 Model Comparison
The following models are trained and compared:

Model	Description	Example Accuracy
Random Forest	Ensemble-based classifier	96%
Logistic Regression	Statistical ML model	93%
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	Margin-based classifier	91%

The bar graph generated by Matplotlib compares the accuracies visually.
